        %Segments - a cell array, each element of the cell array - an array 
        %with three rows, first row has times of points through which
        %the polynomials go, the second row has the values of the function,  
        %and the third row has the orders of the derivatives for which the 
        %values are given
        %
        %Times - a column vector that determines for which segment of time will
        %each polynomial be used.
        %Times has n + 1 elements, where n -  number of segments 
        %(polynomials that comprize the spline)
        %
        % Example:
        %
        % Segments{1} = [0, 0, 2, 4, 4;  - time row
        %                0, 1, 5, 1, 0;  - value row
        %                1, 0, 0, 0, 1]; - derivative order row
        %
        % Segments{2} = [4, 4, 6, 6;  - time row
        %                1, 0, 0, 1;  - value row
        %                0, 1, 1, 0]; - derivative order row
